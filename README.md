#ML with volumes on BTC

Will redo this README, as soon as the project ends. The next is a plan I developed with AI / personal affinities !

Goal: Develop, backtest, and potentially deploy a machine learning model that predicts short-term price movements or generates trading signals based primarily on volume patterns and price-volume interactions for BTC/USD and EUR/USD.

Phase 1: Foundations & Data Acquisition (Est. 1-2 Days)

Define Specific Objectives:

What exactly will the model predict? (e.g., Price direction in next N minutes? Probability of a breakout > X% after a volume spike? A direct buy/sell/hold signal?) Start simple.

What timeframe? (e.g., 1-minute bars, 5-minute bars? Tick data is harder but richer).

Initial focus: BTC/USD via a major crypto exchange API.

Setup Project Environment:

Create a Git repository.

Set up a Python virtual environment (venv).

Initialize requirements.txt.

Data Source Identification & Access:

Crypto (BTC/USD): Research APIs from exchanges like Binance, Bybit, Kraken, Coinbase. Check for historical data download capabilities (OHLCV - Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) at your desired frequency (e.g., 1-minute). ccxt library is excellent for accessing multiple exchanges.

Forex (EUR/USD): Research Forex broker APIs (e.g., OANDA, IG, FXCM) or dedicated data providers (e.g., Dukascopy historical data). Forex volume data can be tricky (decentralized market), often representing tick volume or broker-specific volume. Understand the limitations.

Obtain necessary API keys and understand rate limits/data costs.

Data Fetching Script:

Write Python scripts using selected APIs (ccxt, requests, specific broker libraries) to download historical OHLCV data for BTC/USD and EUR/USD for a significant period (e.g., 1-3 years of 1-minute data).

Handle potential API errors, rate limits, and data gaps.

Data Storage:

Decide on storage: Start with CSV or Parquet files locally for simplicity.

Structure filenames/folders logically (e.g., data/binance/btc_usd/1m/2023.parquet).

Implement basic data cleaning/validation (check for NaNs, outliers, correct dtypes).

Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Feature Engineering (Est. 2-3 Days)

Load & Prepare Data: Use Pandas to load data, parse timestamps, set index.

Visualize Core Data:

Plot Price (candlestick/line) and Volume over time (Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly).

Plot volume distribution (histograms).

Create scatter plots of price change vs. volume change.

Engineer Volume-Based Features: This is the core creative part.

Basic Volume: Raw volume, Volume Moving Averages (SMA, EMA), Volume Rate of Change (ROC).

Relative Volume: Volume / Average Volume (e.g., over last 20 periods). Volume Z-score.

Volume Spikes: Boolean indicator for volume exceeding N standard deviations above its MA.

Price-Volume Interaction:

Price change during high/low volume bars.

Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) and price deviation from VWAP.

Correlation between price range (|High-Low|) and volume.

On-Balance Volume (OBV), Accumulation/Distribution Line (ADL), Chaikin Money Flow (CMF).

Lagged Features: Include past values of volume features and price features.

Define Target Variable:

Simple Start: Binary classification: Will the price close higher (1) or lower (0) N bars from now? (Handle threshold for "significant" change).

Alternative: Regression: Predict the percentage price change over the next N bars.

Feature Selection/Refinement: Analyze feature correlations, potentially use initial feature importance from a simple model (like Random Forest) to guide focus.

Save Processed Data: Store the dataset with engineered features and the target variable.

Phase 3: Model Selection & Training (Est. 2-3 Days)

Data Splitting: CRITICAL: Split data chronologically into Train, Validation, and Test sets. Do not shuffle time series data randomly. (e.g., 70% Train, 15% Validation, 15% Test).

Preprocessing: Scale/normalize features (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler) based only on the training set statistics.

Select Initial Model(s):

Baseline: Logistic Regression (for classification) or Linear Regression (for regression).

Tree-based: RandomForestClassifier/Regressor, XGBoost, LightGBM (often perform well on tabular data).

Sequence (More Advanced): LSTM or GRU (using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch) if sequence patterns seem crucial. Transformer models are possible but add complexity. Start with tree-based.

Implement Training Pipeline:

Load preprocessed data.

Train the model(s) on the training set.

Evaluate initial performance on the validation set (e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score for classification; MSE, MAE for regression).

Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV (or Optuna/Hyperopt) on the validation set to find optimal model parameters.

Save Trained Model: Persist the best-performing model (using joblib or model-specific save functions).

Phase 4: Backtesting & Evaluation (Est. 2-3 Days)

Choose/Build Backtesting Framework:

vectorbt: Excellent for fast, vectorized backtesting if your logic can be expressed with Pandas/NumPy operations. Good fit for Python/Pandas strength.

backtrader: More flexible, event-driven framework. Steeper learning curve.

Custom Vectorized: Build your own using Pandas/NumPy (leverages your skills, gives full control).

Integrate Model & Logic:

Load the trained model.

Use the model to predict signals on the test set.

Define entry/exit rules based on signals (e.g., Buy on '1', Sell on '0').

Implement basic risk management: Stop-loss (percentage or ATR-based), potentially take-profit.

Simulate Trading:

Run the backtest over the test set.

Crucially: Include realistic transaction costs (e.g., 0.05% - 0.1% per trade for crypto) and basic slippage assumptions (can be a fixed amount or dependent on volume/volatility at signal time).

Evaluate Performance:

Calculate key metrics: Total Return, Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Max Drawdown, Win Rate, Profit Factor, CAGR.

Plot the equity curve vs. Buy-and-Hold benchmark.

Analyze trades: Distribution of returns, holding times, etc.

Iterate: Analyze results. Are they realistic? Does performance hold up after costs/slippage? Go back to Phase 2 (feature engineering) or Phase 3 (model tuning/selection) based on findings. This loop is essential.

Phase 5: Refinement & Potential Paper Trading (Ongoing)

Robustness Checks: Test on different time periods, potentially different but related assets. Check sensitivity to transaction costs/slippage assumptions.

Paper Trading Setup (Optional but Recommended):

Connect your signal generation logic to a broker/exchange paper trading account API.

Run the strategy in near real-time using live data feeds.

Monitor performance and compare against backtest results. Identify real-world issues (latency, data discrepancies, API glitches).

Phase 6: Live Deployment (Advanced - Significant Effort)

Infrastructure: Reliable real-time data feed, robust execution engine (API interaction, order management), error handling, logging, monitoring.

Deployment: Containerize the strategy (Docker), decide on hosting (Cloud VM, serverless function, home server).

Risk Management: Implement stricter live risk controls (position sizing, capital allocation, kill switches).

Monitoring: Dashboards to track P&L, risk, system health.

Technology Stack Considerations:

Core: Python 3.x

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy, Parquet-Python (optional)

ML: Scikit-learn (baseline, tuning), XGBoost/LightGBM (tree-based), TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (if using NNs)

APIs: ccxt, requests, specific broker libraries (OANDA, etc.)

Backtesting: vectorbt or backtrader or custom

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (optional, for interactive)

Deployment (Live): Docker, potentially cloud services (GCP/AWS), scheduling tools (cron, Airflow), monitoring tools.

Database (Optional): PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB (for efficient time-series storage if needed).

Potential Challenges:

Data Quality & Availability: Especially historical tick data and reliable volume for Forex.

Feature Engineering: Finding features that capture the volume-price dynamic effectively and have predictive power is hard.

Overfitting: Models can easily overfit noisy financial data. Rigorous validation/testing is key.

Non-Stationarity: Market dynamics change over time; models trained on past data may not work in the future. Regular retraining is needed.

Transaction Costs & Slippage: Underestimating these can make a seemingly profitable strategy unprofitable live.

Live Infrastructure Complexity: Building a reliable, low-latency live trading system is a major engineering challenge.
